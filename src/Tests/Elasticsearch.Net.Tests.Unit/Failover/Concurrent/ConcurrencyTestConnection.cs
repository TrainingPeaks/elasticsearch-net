	/// This simulates a super flakey elasticsearch cluster.
	/// - if random 1-9 is a muliple of 3 throw a 503
	/// - never throws on node 9202 though so that all calls can be expected to always succeed. 
	/// - Sniff can either get back the full cluster or a sufficient subset of it. 
	/// - Our cluster have 5 nodes the recommendation is to have N/2+1 masters so we should atleast see 3 nodes
	/// - anything less would cause a node to be unavailable which is covered in other tests
